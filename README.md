# Introduction
Servr is a simple HTTP server that serves files, directories and verbosely logs requests.
This project has two main qualities:
1. **Easy to use:** servr allows one to start a web server on any Linux/MacOSX using 25 characters, with no requirements (not even libc).
2. **Trustworthy:** servr's code and download script are as simple as they can be, thus can be inspected and verified. We have a very shallow
   dependency tree (just two dependencies other than the Go standard library).

# How to contribute
All contributions/PR/issue/beer are welcome ❤️.

It's easiest to develop _servr_ using Gitpod, a free one-click online IDE (who I happen to be working on):
